My name is Connor Ford and I'm a huge nerd. Here's some facts about me!

- My first brush with programming was at the age of 9, when my dad showed me how to make an HTML file on my (then) state of the art 2012 Toshiba laptop. I started really leaning into computers and development in high school, making projects in various languages and learning something new everyday.
- I'm quite proficient with Python, C++, C#, Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS, SQL, and Bash, and somewhat proficient with C, x86 ASM, Ruby, Rails, Rust, and Powershell.
- My favorite programming languages would have to be C++ for general-use programming, and Python for quick-n-dirty scripting.
- I'm quite interested in cybersecurity, specifically ethical hacking and reverse engineering. I find it fascinating that no security system is without flaw, and am most likely going to pursue a career in pentesting or something similar once I've graduated from college.
- I prefer back-end development to front-end development, purely because of how my brain works. Don't get me wrong, I have tons of respect for web designers and the like, but I'll take an API system over a web page any day of the week.
