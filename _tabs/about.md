My name is Connor Ford and I'm a huge nerd. Here's some facts about me!

- My first brush with programming was at the age of 9, when my dad showed me how to make an HTML file on my (then) state of the art 2012 Toshiba laptop. I started really leaning into computers and development in high school, making projects in various languages and learning something new everyday.
- My favorite all-round programming language would most likely have to be C++, due to it being low-level while maintaining OOP standards in a convenient manner. The stability and reliability that comes with a decades-old language like C++ is also a major plus.
- For scripting/testing, I would have to say my favorite language is Python. It's slow, yes, but it has a (seemingly) unlimited supply of libraries for all of your needs, and is the most human-readible language (in my opinion) that can still manage to pull off some nifty logic.
- I'm quite interested in cybersecurity, specifically ethical hacking and reverse engineering. I find it fascinating that no security system is without flaw, and am most likely going to pursue a career in pentesting or something similar once I've graduated from college.
- I prefer back-end development to front-end development, purely because of how my brain works. Don't get me wrong, I have tons of respect for web designers and the like, but I'll take an API system over a web page any day of the week.
